# TUTOR TRACKER, A DELIGHTFULLY UNNEEDED EXCURSION INTO PROGRAMMING

*(written by Nabeel Sherazi, sherazi.n@husky.neu.edu)*

---
## ABOUT:

A program to help you track various things related to tutoring, such as your
students, sessions, etc. Creates ease of use in logging information and
calculating charges, as well as contacting students. I'm declaring this version
1.0 because all of the initial set of features I decided I wanted are finally
now working. In the future, I will probably add support for things like
inspecting student/transaction information in detail, automatically generating
summary reports, seeings reminders about logging, and more.


## WHY:

because i didn't want to pay for software and i thought it'd be a piece of cake
to write myself lmao

it wasn't


## HOW TO USE:

Start main.py to initialize the program. Setting and data files, if they do not
exist, will be automatically created for you. You can use settings.conf to
change certain aspects about the appearance of the program, but be sure to
follow the directions in the comments of that file. When exiting the program, it
is best to do so via the main menu option, but data is saved quite often so you
should be OK if not.


## BUG FIXING:

Please report all bugs to
https://github.com/nabeelsherazi/tutoring-records/issues. I don't really know
how GitHub issue reporting works yet, but I'm sure I'll figure it out. Also, I'm
sure that there are plenty of bugs in this thing, since I have no idea how to
write a testing framework for it.
